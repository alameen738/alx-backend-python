0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
Introduction
Python's variable annotations, introduced in Python 3.5, provide a way to annotate variables with type information. This can be useful for improving code readability, static type checking, and documentation.

Example Code
The provided code demonstrates the use of various variable annotations in Python:

name: str = "Alice": Annotates the name variable as a string.
numbers: List[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: Annotates the numbers variable as a list of integers.
person: Tuple[str, int] = ("Bob", 30): Annotates the person variable as a tuple containing a string and an integer.
value: Union[str, int] = "Hello": Annotates the value variable as a union of a string or an integer.
people: List[Tuple[str, int]] = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Charlie", 35)]: Annotates the people variable as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer.
Benefits of Variable Annotations
Using variable annotations can provide the following benefits:

Improved Code Readability: Annotating variables with their expected types can make the code more self-documenting and easier to understand.
Static Type Checking: Tools like mypy can use the type annotations to perform static type checking, catching potential type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
Better Documentation: The type annotations can be used to generate documentation for the code, providing clear information about the expected types of variables.
IDE Support: Many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) can leverage the type annotations to provide better code completion, linting, and refactoring support.
Usage
To use the variable annotations, you need to import the necessary types from the typing module, as shown in the example code. The annotations are then added to the variable declarations using the colon (:) syntax, followed by the type information.

Conclusion
Python's variable annotations provide a powerful way to add type information to your code, improving readability, static type checking, and documentation. The example code demonstrates how to use various types of annotations, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of this feature.
